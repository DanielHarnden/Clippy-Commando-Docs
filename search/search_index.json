So I worked on that for a few months, polished up everything, added new content, and... forgot to write patch notes. </p> <p>So the release update isn't documented, as I don't have a full list of additions, removals, and changes from version 0.1.001. Also, there were two updates that never went out to the public that acted as pre-release updates for testing, and those didn't have documentation either! But it's ok since no one will probably ever read this lmao.</p> <p>Play Clippy Commando!</p>"}]}
