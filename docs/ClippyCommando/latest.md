# Version 1.00.00 (December 15th, 2025)
## The Release Update
It's finally out!

---

***I kinda lost the plot on these updates, lol.***

Originally, I was planning to use the early access period as a way to update individual modes one by one with input from players, but as I worked on updates, I realized that one large update would be the better course of action. So I worked on that for a few months, polished up everything, added new content, and... forgot to write patch notes. 

So the release update isn't documented, as I don't have a full list of additions, removals, and changes from version 0.1.001. Also, there were two updates that never went out to the public that acted as pre-release updates for testing, and those didn't have documentation either! But it's ok since no one will probably ever read this lmao.

Play *Clippy Commando*!
